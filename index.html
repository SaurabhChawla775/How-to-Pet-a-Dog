Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Get to know the owner.</h3>
              <p>While you're out on the field trying to get an interview with an owner of a dog, get to know them on a personal level. Making sure the dog isn't a service animal, petting can sometimes be disrespectful, and always obtain consent from the owner. The owner may also give you specific instructions on approaching the dog, make sure always to follow them. If you're the owner or the owner isn't present, get to know yourself, what are you scared of, and what are you comfortable with. In most cases, when the owner isn't present, try not to come in contact with the dog, be cautious.</p>

              <h3>Read the signs of the dog.</h3>
              <p>While approaching the dog, make sure you watch for any signs of aggression or anxiousness, including barking, growling, a stiff tail, or pulling the ears back. If the dog does not start relaxing in about thirty seconds, slowly walk back to where you originally were, or give the dog some space. At this point, it is always recommended to keep treats and a toy nearby.</p>

              <h3>Kneel or squat down to the dog's level.</h3>
              <p>Being at the same level as the dog can make them feel more comfortable, as there is no dominance being asserted. Make sure to not stare directly into the dog's eyes, as this can make them feel uncomfortable. If the dog begins to feel a little more comfortable, give the dog a treat with the owner's permission. Giving the dog a treat can make them warm up to you. </p>

              <h3>Allow the dog to sniff you.</h3>
              <p>If the dog randomly starts sniffing you, don't be scared, as this is totally normal! Dogs typically sniff to determine if you are happy or aggressive and healthy or ill. One great way of allowing the dog to sniff you is to hold out your fist. Make sure you don't tightly hold your fist as this can show a sign of aggressiveness. At this point, the dog may lick you, in most cases meaning that they are comfortable with you.</p>

              <h3>Pet the dog.</h3>
              <p>While approaching the dog to pet it, make sure you have followed all the previous steps and make sure the dog isn't showing any signs of aggressiveness. Start by lightly petting around and below the dog's ears, making sure to approach from the side in the dog's peripheral vision, not from above their face. If the dog seems to be comfortable with this, you may move to different areas, including scratching the back or near their jaw (some dogs may not like being pet near the jaw, so always lookout for signs of aggression at this point). Ensure to stay away from areas like the tail, private parts, or the dog's legs. </p>

              <p>Let the dog know that they have been a good boy/girl. Give the dog a few more treats, always asking the owner for permission before you do. If a toy is available and the dog enjoys playing, play around with the dog after the interview to continue your bond. Let the owner know how appreciative you are before and after the interview for letting you interview them and for petting their dog. </p>
